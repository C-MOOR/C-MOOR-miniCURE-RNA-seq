# About this Course {-}

This miniCURE allows students to develop a project using RNA-seq datasets to introduce how model organisms, high-throughput sequencing, and the scientific process are used in both basic and clinical research.

### Skills Level {- .unlisted}

::: {.notice}
_Genetics_  
**Novice**: Introduction to [central dogma of molecular biology](https://openstax.org/books/biology-2e/pages/15-1-the-genetic-code)

_Programming skills_  
**Novice**: No programming experience needed
:::

### Format {- .unlisted}

- **Class Type:** Lab (computer based)
- **Lesson Length:** Multiple class periods (4-5 lab periods)
    - Scientific Literature
    - Model Organisms and Databases
    - RNA-seq Analysis
    - Differential Gene Expression
    - *Kickstart Project Work

*Kickstart Project Work is flexible - it is enormously helpful for students to to have some guided lab time to work on the project, but this can be overlapped with a wet-lab protocol with a lot of downtime, such as PCR.

### Learning Goals {-}

- **Navigate biological databases** to access the wealth of available scientific knowledge and data.
- **Analyze data (i.e. create and interpret plots)** to generate novel conclusions.
- **Cultivate an “-omics” perspective**, integrating multiple sources of information and wielding computational tools to enable a holistic approach
- **Practice the scientific process**, identifying avenues for research, designing experiments, analyzing data, and integrating results into the broader scientific discourse.
