The purpose of this assignment is to register for a SciServer account, and then to inform the instructor of your username so that you can be added to the SciServer group for this course and access course materials. 0.1.2 Learning Objectives Create an account on SciServer Confirm your email address Share your username with your instructor 0.1.3 Introduction SciServer is an online platform for doing scientific data analysis. It is used by scientists studying astronomy, biology, oceanography, and more, and is free as long as you are using it for scientific research. Using SciServer means you do not need a fancy computer or need to install any special programs on your computer, you can just log in with your internet browser to start doing research. For this course, we have set up SciServer with customized collections of programs for RNA-seq analysis, as well as the data that we’ll be analyzing. Once you sign up for SciServer and are added to the group for this course, you will be able to access these tools and begin your data analysis journey! 0.1.4 Instructions 0.1.4.1 Create an account on SciServer This video (video)(slides) shows you how to create a SciServer account. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser It is a good idea to bookmark this page so that you can easily access it throughout the course. Click “Login to SciServer” Click “Create a new account” Enter a User name, Email, etc. and click “Create account” Note that you cannot change your username 0.1.4.2 Confirm your email address Important!: Click the verification link in your email inbox. If you do not verify your account you will get locked out and will need to contact your instructor to unlock your account. If you do not see an email, try checking your spam. After clicking the verification link, confirm that your username appears in the upper right hand corner. 0.1.4.2.1 Resources sciserver.org How to add a bookmark in Chrome SciServer help page 0.1.4.3 Share your username with your instructor Fill out this form with your SciServer username. 0.1.5 Footnotes 0.1.5.1 Contributions and Affiliations Katherine Cox, Johns Hopkins University Frederick Tan, Carnegie Institution Last Revised: January 25, 2022 "],["0.2-first-learnr.html", "0.2 First LearnR", " 0.2 First LearnR Interactive tutorials introducing various data science concepts 0.2.1 Purpose The purpose of this assignment is to (1) join the class SciServer group so you can access course materials, and (2) learn how to access the tutorials for this course on SciServer. 0.2.2 Learning Objectives Accept invitation to join class SciServer Group Start up a C-MOOR LearnR compute container Complete your first LearnR tutorial Delete your C-MOOR LearnR compute container 0.2.3 Introduction Before beginning this assignment, you should have already created a SciServer account and submitted your SciServer username to your instructor. In this assignment you will learn how to set up a “compute container” on SciServer. Compute containers are how you use programs on SciServer. In this course you will use two compute containers: “C-MOOR LearnR” has tutorials that will teach you how to run data analyses, and “C-MOOR R-Studio” is where you will work on your own data analysis projects. This assignment shows you how to set up the C-MOOR LearnR compute container and start up your first tutorial. 0.2.4 Instructions 0.2.4.1 Accept invitation to join class SciServer group This video (video)(slides) shows you how to join a SciServer group. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. Click “Groups” On the left, you should see a list of all the groups you have joined or been invited to. Click on the name of the group for this course, then click “Accept invitation”. Your instructor must have your username to invite you to the group. If you do not see an invitation, contact your instructor with your SciServer username. Confirm that you can access course data On the top menu bar, click “Files” On the left-hand menu, click “Data Volumes” Confirm that you see “C-MOOR-Data” Confirm that you can access course computing resources Click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, confirm that you can see “C-MOOR LearnR” and “C-MOOR R-Studio” Under “Data Volumes”, confirm that you can see “C-MOOR Data” You can close the Create Container dialog box (by clicking the “X” in the top right) once you’ve confirmed that you can see the C-MOOR content 0.2.4.1.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 0.2.4.2 Start up a “C-MOOR LearnR” compute container This video (video)(slides) shows you how to create and start up a C-MOOR LearnR compute container. You can follow along with the video, or follow the steps below. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute” Click “Create container” Give your container a name. This can be anything you like, but it’s useful if it says something about the purpose of the container so you can tell your containers apart. You could name this container “Tutorials”, since you’ll be using it to access tutorials. In the “Compute Image” drop-down menu, select “C-MOOR LearnR” Under “Data Volumes”, check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” Click “Create”. This may take a moment. You should now see a new entry in your list of containers “Created At” should be a few moments ago. “Name” should be the name you chose “Image” should be “C-MOOR LearnR” Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name (whatever name you chose when you created it). This will open in a new tab. You should see a list of tutorials, organized by date. If instead you see an error message, you most likely forgot to check the box next to “C-MOOR Data” when you created the container. If you see something else, you may have picked the wrong “Compute Image” from the drop-down menu. If anything goes wrong, you can always delete your container by clicking the red “X” in the last column, and create a new container. 0.2.4.2.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 0.2.4.3 Complete your first LearnR tutorial If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page and start up the C-MOOR LearnR container. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name. Click on “Biological Databases”. The tutorial will open in a new tab. Complete the tutorial. 0.2.4.3.1 Resources sciserver.org Get help with SciServer on the C-MOOR Discourse 0.2.4.4 Delete your C-MOOR LearnR compute container Compute containers are meant to be temporary, and you can only have 3 containers total on SciServer. So it’s generally a good idea to clean up after yourself and delete your containers when you’re done using them. Also, in this course, we will be updating the tutorials on the C-MOOR LearnR container, and you will need to create a new container to get the latest updates. Deleting your container will delete your progress in a tutorial, so don’t delete the container until you have completed the tutorial and submitted any required items to your instructor. Later on in the course you will learn how to save things permanently on SciServer. To delete a container: If you’re not there already, go to the SciServer compute page. Open sciserver.org in a web browser and log in to your account. If you are already logged in, click “Home” in the top menu to return to the home page. Scroll down to the second set of boxes and click “Compute”. Start your C-MOOR LearnR container by clicking on its name. Find the container you want to delete.
