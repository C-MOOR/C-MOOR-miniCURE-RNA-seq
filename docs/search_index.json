Some of the most important genetic model organisms in use today. Clockwise from top left: yeast, fruit fly, arabidopsis, mouse, roundworm, zebrafish. License: CC ANS 2.5 4.1.1 Purpose The two tutorials in this pre-lab will familiarize you with the concepts of model organisms, with an emphasis on Drosophila. In Lab 8, this information will help you look up information about Drosophila genes. 4.1.2 Learning Objectives Explain the importance of model organisms and identify some of their desirable characteristics. Describe the usefulness of Drosophila as a model system. 4.1.3 Introduction Scientists frequently use a few specific organisms, called “model organisms” for their experiments. This tutorial will introduce you to a few of the most popular model organisms and will discuss why these organisms were chosen and what they are useful for. The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a popular model organism used to study a wide range of biological questions. The second tutorial will introduce you to some of the types of research being conducted with fruit flies, give a brief overview of Drosophila biology, and show you what it’s like to work with Drosophila in the lab. 4.1.4 Activity 1 - Model Organisms Estimated time: 15 min 4.1.4.1 Instructions Click here to open the Model Organisms Tutorial.

This will give you an opportunity to engage in inquiry-based learning and apply the concepts in molecular biology and genetics from this course. 4.3.2 Learning Objectives Use online databases to look up information about a gene. 4.3.3 Activity 1 - Databases Estimated time: 15 min 4.3.3.1 Instructions Follow these directions to launch your first LearnR tutorial: Biological Databases Tutorial. To move through the activities click “Continue” at the bottom of the screen. When you are done with a topic, click “Next Topic” to move on. As you complete the tutorial, fill in the table below. This will help you know which database to go back to later on. 4.3.3.2 Questions Table 1.

What is one question you have about using HPA? 3B. What is something that surprised you or that you found interesting about using HPA? 4.3.6 Activity 4 - Research a Gene! Estimated time: 45 min 4.3.6.1 Instructions Before getting started on this activity, your instructor will assign your group a letter that corresponds to a group of 4 genes. Group Assigned Letter Look up your letter here and write the names of the four genes your group is assigned at the top of each column in the table below. In your group, assign each student one of the four genes to research. Individual Assigned Gene Use FlyBase to look up the information in Table 2 below. Use HPA to look up the information in Table 3 below. Table 2. FlyBase Information Category Information General Information Full Gene Name FlyBase ID Sequence Location Function Biological Process Cellular Component Expression Data Anatomical Expression Developmental Stage Orthologs Orthologs in other species Human Orthologs Table 3. Human Protein Atlas Category Information Function Is the gene tissue specific? Which tissue? Where is it localized in cells? 4.3.7 Activity 5 - Present to your Group Estimated time: 15 min 4.3.7.1 Instructions Present your gene to your group. Take turns presenting your genes among your group and decide on one gene that you think is the most interesting. 4.3.8 Activity 6 - Class Presentation Estimated time: 30 min 4.3.8.1 Instructions With your group, create a short presentation to present your chosen gene to the class. Your presentation should have about four slides and be thorough: Slide 1: The GENE you picked to share with your group, your name and date Slide 2 - 4: Present the information you collected about the gene. For full credit, include relevant images/ diagrams on your slides. One student in the group should post your slides on Canvas to the discussion board. Make sure you mention everyone in your group by name so they also get credit for the presentation. 4.3.9 Footnotes 4.3.9.1 Resources Google Doc 4.3.9.2 Contributions and Affiliations Rosa Alcazar, Ph.D., Clovis Community College Katherine Cox, Ph.D., John Hopkins Stephanie R.
