## Purpose 

The two tutorials in this pre-lab will familiarize you with the concepts of model organisms, with an emphasis on Drosophila. In Lab 8, this information will help you look up information about Drosophila genes.


## Learning Objectives 

1. Explain the importance of model organisms and identify some of their desirable characteristics. 
1. Describe the usefulness of Drosophila as a model system.

## Introduction 

Scientists frequently use a few specific organisms, called “model organisms” for their experiments. This tutorial will introduce you to a few of the most popular model organisms and will discuss why these organisms were chosen and what they are useful for.

The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is a popular model organism used to study a wide range of biological questions. The second tutorial will introduce you to some of the types of research being conducted with fruit flies, give a brief overview of Drosophila biology, and show you what it’s like to work with Drosophila in the lab.
