### Teaching Suggestions {-}

Here are some practical suggestions for teaching the miniCURE that we have found to work well in our classrooms.

#### Check-ins {-}

Developing a scientific project, even a “mini” one, is a challenging task for students, and we have found that they fare much better with frequent opportunities for feedback. We use several check-ins to provide opportunities for students to work on small portions of their project and receive guidance.  Keeping these check-ins small in scope helps the students set achievable goals and reduces the time needed for instructors to review them. The exact number, content, and format of these check-ins has varied across different classes and instructors, but here are several types check-ins we have found useful:

- **Initial group check-in**: At the end of the final core lab, we provide students time to form groups and begin discussing project ideas. Each group is required to submit a list of group members and one project idea. They are not required to stick with this idea, but this check-in makes sure they have identified their group and have started thinking about the project.
- **Project proposal**: Students submit a project proposal, structured as an abstract, that describes their research question, hypothesis, methods, and general rationale. This may go through a couple of rounds of feedback to help them clarify their ideas.
- **Figure check-in(s)**: Over the rest of the course, students are occasionally required to submit a “figure” (e.g. one graph) and list 2-3 next steps to work on before the next lab. The instructor provides feedback on their direction, offering additional ideas or helping them get back on track.
- **Primary Source check-in**: Students must submit one primary source reference. Students are often confused about what a primary source is; this check-in helps make sure they are finding appropriate sources.
- **Rough Draft**: Before the end of the course, students are required to submit a draft of their posters.  The instructor gives feedback to incorporate into their final draft.

#### Timely, Written Feedback {-}

We have found that providing timely, written feedback is important for improving students’ projects and posters. While verbal feedback during lab can be helpful, students don’t always remember it, or don’t know how to spell a term to look up later. Written feedback gives them something concrete to reference as they work on their projects. We instituted several small-scale check-ins to provide opportunities for instructors to give written feedback on components of the projects and posters. We found it particularly helpful to have students write down their next steps as part of these check-ins, as this gave the instructor an opportunity to redirect groups before they spent too much time going in unproductive directions.

#### External Feedback {-}

When developing their projects and posters, in addition to receiving feedback from their instructor, it can be helpful for students to receive feedback through available institutional resources. For example, at Clovis Community College we have encouraged students to visit the campus “Tutorial Center”. Advisors do not need to be experts in *Drosophila* biology or R coding to help students with their projects. For most students, the hard part is not the coding or the details about specific genes. Instead, students need guidance in thinking through their project - pulling information together to generate a question or hypothesis, drawing useful insights from plots, connecting multiple pieces of information to generate conclusions, synthesizing a coherent story about their results, and creating a compelling poster. We encourage instructors to make use of campus resources. TAs and STEM help centers can assist with developing projects, or you may have library services that can assist with crafting posters. This lightens the load of the instructor and connects students with institutional resources available to them.

#### Google Doc Assignments {-}

Our assignments are provided as both a webpage and a Google Doc, so that instructors can use whichever format is most convenient for their course. We have found Google Docs to be the easiest way for collaborators from multiple different institutions to share documents and files. We maintain Google Doc versions of our assignments so that instructors from different institutions can easily customize them if desired. They can be downloaded from the Google Doc in a variety of formats depending on what is most convenient for the instructor (Word, PDF, Open Document, etc.)

Google Docs can be convenient for students as well, particularly for group work. Many students are comfortable with Google Docs and already have Google accounts. We typically give students a link for read-only access to the assignment, then have them make a copy of it for themselves (or have one member make a copy for the group and invite other members). Students can fill in answers directly in their copy of the assignment, and submit a link to their (or their group’s) completed assignment.

One common problem when having students submit Google Doc links is that they forget to also “share” their document with the instructor. This means the instructor is unable to view their document. When assignments are due, it can be helpful to quickly go through the submitted links and confirm that you can access the documents, even if you don’t have time to grade them right away. This gives you a chance to request access for any problematic documents.



### Sample schedules {- #sample-schedules}

Here is an example of how this RNA-seq miniCURE was incorporated into the BIOL11A "Biology for Science Majors" lab at Clovis Community College and into the BIO239 "Genetics" lab at Notre Dame of Maryland University.

"Optional" refers to activities related to the mini-CURE that are not part of the core curriculum (a pre- and post- test surveying student experiences, a visit to the on-campus "tutorial center" where students can receive help and advice, and the printing and presenting of posters).
